          <p>If you are enrolled in CSP for the 2018-2019 school year, please take the time to get comfortable with the following concepts before the start of the school year.</p>
          <p>If you were enrolled in Computer Programming during 2017-2018, then you've seen most or all of the following lessons already, but it's worth spending a little time refreshing yourself before the start of the school year.</p>
          <p>Contact me anytime with your questions: room 7 during the school day, and andrewsmith@wcsu.net after school or during summer.</p>
