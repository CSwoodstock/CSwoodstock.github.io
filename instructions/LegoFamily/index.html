<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Practice using functions, variables, declarations, and assignment statements.</li>
  <li>Make computations dynamic in interesting ways.</li>
  <li>Create an <em>abstracted</em> image of a recognizable family using simple shapes.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>You may choose to start from scratch or use the starter code in the assignment repo as a starting point.</p>


<h2>Lego Family</h2>

<p>
You will program your very own lego family.
You can base it off of a TV show (Simpsons is shown below, so you may not choose the Simpsons), a movie, a comic, or even your own family if you want to.
You may look <a href="http://creativecriminals.com/print/lego/characters">here</a> for more inspiration, but your creation should be your own and not copied from somewhere else.
</p>

<h3>Specifications</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Background color is not white.</li>
  <li>The drawing canvas should be around 900x600, but adjust as needed for your project.</li>
  <li>Each character should be made out of rectangles, but feel free to add in more details with other shapes (like Maggie's pacifier -- an ellipse).</li>
  <li>At least three different fill colors should be used for your family.</li>
  <li>Your family must consist of a minimum of three characters.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 1: Sketch</h3>

<p>
Decide on the inspiration for your family.
Sketch out your family on paper, color it in, and label all the important points so it is easier to program.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> You will be submitting your sketches, so keep them with you.
</p>


<h3>Step 2: Program Your Family</h3>

<p>
Program your family in the center of the screen, making sure each character lines up on the same baseline (see the Simpson family image).
</p>

<h4>Helpful Reminders:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Positions on the screen are numbered from (0,0) in the upper-left corner and increase to the right and down.
      On a 900x600 drawing canvas, the middle position in the top row is (450,0).</li>
  <li>Sizes are always given width before height.</li>
  <li>Colors are given by three numbers between 0-255 for 'red', 'green', and 'blue' (RGB).</li>
  <li>An object's color is set with the <code>fill(r,g,b)</code> function, where r, g, and b are the three color values.
      Once set, all following shapes are filled with that color until a new <code>fill()</code> command changes the color.</li>
  <li><code>noStroke()</code> will remove the outlines around your shapes.</li>
  <li>Use [Help -&gt; Reference] if you want to look up a function.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 3: Add Variables</h3>

<p>
At the top of your code, add an <code>x_position</code> and <code>y_position</code> variable for each family member, then add these variables into your code as shown in class.
Examples for the Simpsons variables are shown below.
<b>Run your code, and make sure each character is now starting in a corner.</b>
</p>

<table align=center>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#dddddd">Character</td>
    <td bgcolor="#dddddd">Variable Names</td>
    <td rowspan=6 width=100>&nbsp;</td>
    <td rowspan=6 valign=middle><img src="family_start.png" height=200></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Homer</td>
    <td>homer_x, homer_y</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Marge</td>
    <td>marge_x, marge_y</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bart</td>
    <td>bart_x, bart_y</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lisa</td>
    <td>lisa_x, lisa_y</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Maggie</td>
    <td>maggie_x, maggie_y</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h4>Declaring Variables:</h4>
<p>
To understand our programs Processing needs to know what variables we will use in our program, so we <em>declare</em> them.
Declarations come at the start of our program (before <code>setup()</code>) by writing code such as <code>int position = 0;</code>.
</p>
<p>This line of code tells Processing several things:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>position</code> is a variable that will be used in the program.</li>
  <li><code>position</code> will have integer values (whole numbers) because we used the abbreviation <code>int</code> for integer.</li>
  <li><code>position</code> starts with the value 0.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Using Variables:</h4>

<p>
A variable holds a value that can change.
For example, if the variable <code>position</code> holds the value 21 and then later in the program we write <code>position = 23;</code>, then the value of <code>position</code> has changed from what it was (21) to 23.
Variables are important to dynamic programs, because values change all the time.
</p>


<h3>Step 4: Move Your Family</h3>

<p>
Program your family to start in the corners and move to the center of the screen.
If you have 3 characters, pick 3 different corners;
if you have 4 characters, use all 4 corners;
if you have more than 4 characters, you can have multiple characters start in the same corner.
</p>

<p>
You will be adding statements like <code>homer_x = homer_x + 1;</code> or <code>homer_x = homer_x - 1;</code> into your code to make this movement happen.
</p>

<p>
Here we are using the fact that the <code>draw()</code> routine refreshes the image several times per second.
Each time it runs <code>draw()</code> it repeats the "change" operation (such as <code>homer_x = homer_x + 1;</code>).
This alters the variable's value.
By using that variable to set the position of shapes, we can make your characters move across the screen!
</p>

<table align=center>
  <tr>
    <td valign=middle><img src="family_start.png" height=200></td>
    <td valign=middle align=center>&nbsp; ==&gt; &nbsp;</td>
    <td valign=middle><img src="family_end.png" height=200></td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h3>Step 5: Stop Your Family</h3>

<p>
Finally, you will want to program your family to stop once it has reached the center.
To do this you will want to use the <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code> functions as shown in class.
</p>

<p>
For the Simpsons, we might use something like <code>homer_x = min(0, homer_x);</code> OR <code>homer_x = max(0, homer_x);</code>

  <h4>Submission</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure that most of your lines of code have comments so that someone else can understand it.</li>
    <li>Submit your sketch from Step 1 (<code>.jpg</code>, <code>.png</code>, or <code>.pdf</code>) along with your finished <code>.pde</code> file from Step 5 to the <a href="../assignments.php">Canvas assignments page</a>.</li>
    <li>You should add this program to your portfolio.</li>
  </ul>
