  Bring your computer to next class. Make sure you can run sketches in Processing on it.
You'll need to bring a laptop to class with you every day. (If this is a hardship, see Mr. Smith immediately. We will find a good solution.) That laptop needs to have a free program called 'Processing' installed on it.
Read and do the 'getting started' page for Processing <a href='https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/'>here</a>. This includes installing Processing and doing the other actions mentioned on that page.
Browse some of the examples mentioned in 'getting started', and pick one that you think is interesting (keep it on your screen to help you answer questions in the form you'll submit below).
Follow <a href='/resources.html#create-github-account'>these instructions</a> to create a github account (be sure to remember your username).
Take some time to thoughtfully answer the questions in <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfsKhDzhB7vfdPhBgdkMGppj1y5A5JO00PUJnRbzdC2xEtmkQ/viewform?usp=sf_link'>this form</a>.
