                  <p><em>Abstraction reduces information and detail to facilitate focus on relevant concepts.</em> Everyone uses abstraction on a daily basis to effectively manage complexity. In computer science, abstraction is a central problem-solving technique. It is a process, a strategy, and the result of reducing detail to focus on concepts relevant to understanding and solving problems. This course requires students to use abstractions to model the world and communicate with people as well as with machines. Students in this course learn to work with multiple levels of abstraction while engaging with computational problems and systems; use models and simulations that simplify complex topics in graphical, textual, and tabular formats; and use snapshots of models and simulation outputs to understand how data changes, identify patterns, and recognize abstractions.</p>

     <p><em></em> Everyone uses abstraction on a daily basis to effectively manage complexity. In computer science, abstraction is a central problem-solving technique. It is a process, a strategy, and the result of reducing detail to focus on concepts relevant to understanding and solving problems. This course requires students to use abstractions to model the world and communicate with people as well as with machines. Students in this course learn to work with multiple levels of abstraction while engaging with computational problems and systems; use models and simulations that simplify complex topics in graphical, textual, and tabular formats; and use snapshots of models and simulation outputs to understand how data changes, identify patterns, and recognize abstractions.</p>
